## TutorGym

This library contains headless versions of a number of commonly used tutoring system environments for training simulated students.  There are currently two different tutoring systems that can be loaded: the fraction arithmetic tutor and a multi-column arithmetic tutor.

## Installation

To install the base Gym library, use `pip install tutorgym`. (NOTE: Not on PYPI yet - but need to add)



## Environment Versioning

We recommend using Python 3.8.0 for this project.
